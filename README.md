### A funny story
Not sure if this is a funny story, but maybe it's a fun fact.
I've been scared of worms for a long time. When I was little I got a McDonald Magic box. It contained flower bulbs for Hyacinths and during planting I of course came across worms. It took until this year before I overcame my "trauma".
