### You can always count on me when ...
you need someone to listen and doesn't judge. I'll try to help... if I can and have the knowledge.

### A funny story
Not sure if this is a funny story, but maybe it's a fun fact.
I've been scared of worms for a long time. When I was little I got a McDonald Magic box. It contained flower bulbs for Hyacinths and during planting I came across worms of course. It took until this year before I overcame my "trauma" and dare to pickup a worm.
